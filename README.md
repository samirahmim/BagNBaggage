4.1 DDS project.
Our project is a store where people can find a variety of bags like backpacks, totes, handbags,
wallets, clutches, and so on. Bags are fundamental to the development of human civilization
because they allow people to collect essentials and also make us stylish.

bags four fragmentation schema(Bag1, Bag2, Bag3, Bag4) created using mixed fragmentation.
Using horizontal fragmentation on Purchase two fragments created based on their purchasing
quantity. We implemented here, BAG, Category,Customer,Bills.
